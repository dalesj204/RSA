CIS 475 Introduction to Cryptography. Assignment 2 (Spring 2023) If you have come this far then you know how RSA works. For this assignment, you have to submit many files. The first file is this decrypted file. For the second file: provide your own implementation of the RSA crypto system in any programming language of your choice. Allow the user a freedom to choose the bit-length for their prime numbers. Your system should encrypt only single ASCII characters from text files without salting. Your program should take four input parameters: a plaintext filename, a cipher text filename, and a filename for the decrypted text, and a bit-length parameter. The cipher text should be a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. Submit your source code. For the third file: you have to encrypt this file using your own implementation of RSA and send me the decrypted file. For the fourth file: Send me the RSA modulus and the secret exponent required to decrypt the file so I can decrypt it properly. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask me. RSA assignment is due Feb 28th midnight.
