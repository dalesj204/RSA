## RSA Implementation

Created February 2023. This repository contains two programs using the RSA algorithm. 
One program (rsa.py) takes a cipher from a file and decrypts it into a new file. 
The other program (rsa_program_revised.py) encrypts a plain text file with a cipher and decrypts into a new text file.

This implementation is based on Number Theory algorithms such as Chinese Remainder Theorem, Euclidean Algorithm (GCD), and Extended Euclidean Algorithm (Pulverizer).
